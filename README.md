## Startup Expansion Analysis

# Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset related to startup expansion using Python. The notebook performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive insights that can help in decision-making for business growth.

# Dataset

The analysis is based on `startup-expansion.xlsx`, which contains key business metrics related to startup performance and expansion trends.

# Installation & Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
```

# Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook. :  https\://github.com/M07amedrabea/Startup-Expanding.git
2. Ensure `startup-expansion.xlsx` is placed in the correct directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`code.ipynb`) to execute the analysis.

# Notebook Breakdown

1. **Import Libraries**: Load required libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2. **Load and Inspect Data**: Read the dataset and check its structure.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, clean data, and prepare it for analysis.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summary statistics
   - Data distributions
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizations
5. **Insights & Conclusions**: Interpretation of key findings from the analysis.

# Output

- Data visualizations and statistical insights about startup expansion.
- Recommendations based on data trends.
